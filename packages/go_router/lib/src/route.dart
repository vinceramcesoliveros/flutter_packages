/// The base class for [GoRoute] and [ShellRoute].
///
/// Routes are defined in a tree such that parent routes must match the
/// current location for their child route to be considered a match. For
/// example the location "/home/user/12" matches with parent route "/home" and
/// child route "user/:userId".
///
/// To create sub-routes for a route, provide them as a [GoRoute] list
/// with the sub routes.
///
/// For example these routes:
/// ```
/// /         => HomePage()
///   family/f1 => FamilyPage('f1')
///     person/p2 => PersonPage('f1', 'p2') ← showing this page, Back pops ↑
/// ```
///
/// Can be represented as:
///
/// ```
/// final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
///   routes: <GoRoute>[
///     GoRoute(
///       path: '/',
///       pageBuilder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) => MaterialPage<void>(

///         child: HomePage(families: Families.data),

///       ],
///     ),

///
/// If there are multiple routes that match the location, the first match is used.

/// ```

///     GoRoute(
///       path: '/',
///       redirect: (_) => '/family/${Families.data[0].id}',
